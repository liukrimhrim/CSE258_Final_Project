# Assignment II Report



The dataset we choose is the renown handwritten digits dataset MNIST by LeCun Yann. 

The predictive task we are performing is pretty straightforward: given an input image, we are to predict which handwritten digit is on the image.

The first lesson we learned about machine learning is: simple models are oftentimes better than complex models. Therefore, we will set linear classifier model as the baseline. If more complex models cannot significantly outperform the baseline, then we should just stick to this simple model.
